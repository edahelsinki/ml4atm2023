# Machine learning for atmospheric processes
*Half-day workshop at ECML PKDD 2023*

## Abstract
This half-day workshop, organised in conjunction with ECML PKDD 2023 conference,
aims to bring domain atmospheric scientists and machine learners together to
understand micro-scale processes within the atmosphere and their effects on the
larger scales, including climate change and weather.
The non-exclusive list of topics for the workshop includes
(as related to the topic of the workshop):
- Modelling of atmospheric processes 
- Explainable A.I. for sciences
- Methods and tools for scientist-computer interaction
- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and their application for natural sciences
- Machine learning models (including probabilistic and deep learning) for sciences
- Active learning
- Visualisation and visual analytics for sciences 
- Design of experiments
- Digital twins and virtual laboratories 
- High-performance computing for machine learning or atmospheric processes
